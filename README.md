- This repository contains a System Programming Project which aims to provide Media Security in Linux Operating System through extensive use of Shell Scripting and C Programming. 
  I developed it as an applied learning project for my subject 'System Programming' in Semester-2, MSc IT. 

This project extensively uses the concept of shell scripting to provide multiple functionalities of media security simultaneously to the user. 
It enables the system to efficiently hide and handle the background complexities involved in the equivalent GUI Operations through the terminal itself. 
In combination with concepts like Process Management, Pipes, File I/O and Signals, it creates a user-friendly environment. Complex functionalities like 
encryption and decryption of multiple media, hiding/unhiding media and,changing their permissions are provided to the user on concurrently executing multiple child
terminals. Logs are also generated for every parent and child process, which clearly elaborates when and which media was affected (successful/unsuccessful operations) 
by which child process. This project thus, comprises multiple system programming concepts and solves the real-world problem of securing media on a small-scale.

- Note: Comprehensive Details of the Project is elaborated in The Project Description Document.
